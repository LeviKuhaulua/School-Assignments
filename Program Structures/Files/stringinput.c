  This function reads characters from the input steam,

  and adds a null character ('\0') after the last character in the string.
  It will read up to size-1 number of characters.
  And will read until the end of file, newline, blank space, or tab.
  And will leave the rest of the characters on the input stream.
  Warning: If the string array has less than size number of characters,
  this may crash the program, or write over memory!
  If there are no characters added to the string, a 0 is returned.
  string: An array of characters, with size number of elements.
  size: The number of characters in the string array.
  returns: The number of characters read into the string.
