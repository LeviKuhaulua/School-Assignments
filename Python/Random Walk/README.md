# Random Walk Assignment

Using the turtle we will have it: 
1. Pick a random direction (North, South, East, West)
2. Walk forward

Continue this process until the Turtle reaches back to it's original coordinates. 

**Challenge** <br> 
Same premise but the turtle has to ***avoid*** the paths that it already took. 

***NOTES***: 
1. Turtle will go 30 pixels forward
2. Directions
    - 0 = East
    - 90 = North
    - 180 = West 
    - 270 = South 
3. **Don't forget about turtle reaching boundaries / end of canvas**
4. Need to store coordinates that turtle has previously been to.
