# Homework 3 

# Task (from the book)

> Write a new static method to allow you to "add" two Statisticians. If `s1` and `s2` are two statisticians, then the result of adding them should be a new statistician that behaves as if it had all of the numbers of `s1` followed by all of the numbers of `s2`. 


# Note from the instructor 

The **add** method should not print anything nor should this method **<u>modify</u>** the two Statisticians objects.
