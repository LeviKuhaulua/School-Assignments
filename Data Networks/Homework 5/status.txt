Issue once we try to connect to socket at specified port. 

server.c output:
Server created at 14000
Server listening at 14000

then hangs as it's waiting for a connections

Telnet side: 
- Using netstat to get the port (I used 1400)
- Tried combinations telnet localhost/127.0.0.1/0.0.0.0/my.own.ip.address 14000 but get error message
    - Connection closed by foreign host
    - If it helps, I used a docker container to containerize the code and then run telnet
        - However, I did use telnet in both the docker container and outside depending on what options I used when starting the container
