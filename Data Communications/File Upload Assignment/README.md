# Assignment 5 

**Goal**: Write Java code to create a socket to perform a file upload transmission. 

## Client Side: 

1. Connect to the Server 
2. Say `aloha` to the Server
3. When the welcome message is received from the server, it will upload a file (e.g. "paper.txt") to the server. 
4. Close the socket when the client receives the message: `Your file named ServerXXX.txt with the size XXXX bytes has been uploaded correctly`

## Server Side: 

1. Wait for the connection
2. When the server receives `aloha` from the client, it will send back a welcome message 
3. Server starts to receive the file sent by the client and stores it into a new file named `ServerXXX.txt` where XXX stands for a random number generated by the server
4. After the server successfully receives the whole file from the client, it will send message to the client `Your file named ServerXXX.txt with the size XXXX bytes has been uploaded correctly`
5. Close the server socket

## Additional Comments: 
Need to show the file in the directories at both client and server sides. If you use single computer to run both server and client sockets, create two different folders for server and client, respectively.
